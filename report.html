    <p>Cons:  My menu-button, I wasn't able to get it to pop up the tab menu.<br> Spent more time on the Inventory and lost sight of the whole picture of the website itself.  Isn't fully completed to the best of my ability.  Contacts page, I wasn't able to get user feedback which I was trying to do but failed to do so.</p>
    <p>Pros:  This met a bit of the criteria for project 1 because I separated the uses of my files such as images into its own folder, javascript in its own file, and css styles in its own file.<br>  I have more than five webpages which I spent more time on in the inventory webpage.  I had some sort of navigation.  all my files were lowercased, and in terms of responsiveness my website changes its layout when in mobile or desktop</p>
    <h1>Critique From Client</h1>
    <p>I had my roommate Will Xiong as my client.  He's a business major and thought my website was good in its most simplest form of delivering product to the customer although he was a little disappointed that I wasn't able to get the website working from a mobile version since I wasn't able to get the tab/menu button to work.  He loved how consistent my layout was because it was very simple and direct.  It was also easy to navigate the inventory.</p>
